# Matrix-Operation-OpenMP-MPI

Parallel and Distributed Computing Project

main.cpp
contains serial and parallel implementation using OpenMP of:
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Subtraction
- Matrix Transposition
- Matrix Inversion

mpi_main.cpp
Contains serial and parallel implementation using MPI of matrix multiplication

generator.cpp
Generates two random matrices in txt files where sizes of matrices is given by user at runtime.

checker.cpp
Checks if any two files have same results particularly for checking if OpenMP and MPI yeilds the same matrix in parallel processing.
